# Link Tracker

The Link Tracker is a chrome extension that can save URLs of any website. This Link Tracker saves all the previously saved links and enables users to add or delete links as they choose.

There are four features available to the user: 
1. Save URL - Manually save the URL of any website by pasting the URL in the input field
2. Save Tab - Save the URL of the current tab that the user is on
3. Delete Last - Delete the most recently saved URL
4. Delete All - Delete all of the URLs that a user has previously saved

Users can revisit the Link Tracker chrome extension at any time to relocate their saved links and navigate to their preferred webpage, all with the click of a button!
