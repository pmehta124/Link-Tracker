# Link Tracker

The Link Tracker is a chrome extension that can save URL links from any website. This Link Tracker saves all the previously saved links and enables users to add or delete URL links as they choose.

There are four features available to the user: 
1. Save Link - Manually save the URL link of any website by pasting the link in the input field
2. Save Tab - Save the URL link of the current tab that the user is on
3. Delete Last - Delete the most recently saved URL link
4. Delete All - Delete all of the links that a user has previously saved

Users can revisit the Link Tracker chrome extension at any time to relocate their saved URL links and navigate to their preferred link, all with the click of a button!
